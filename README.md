# MusicPlayer-with-JS-CSS-HTML
In this project, where I used HTML-CSS-JS in a simple structure, I tried to use the JS structure quite a bit. 

I tried to enrich the visuals with a colorful background and a colorful music player.

I tried to show JS time and audio features meticulously and I tried to show how to manage HTML and CSS with JS.

If you see an error in my code or have an idea to add something, please feel free to contact me
